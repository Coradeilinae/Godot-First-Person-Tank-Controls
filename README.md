# Godot First Person Tank Controls
 This is my code for First Person Tank Controls in Godot, it is hopefully very obviously incredibly basic, and only put up so that alternative methods to first person camera controls can be used and expanded upon 
 
 Any variables can be adjusted for comfort, the most important are 
 
 Sensitivity_X which controls left right look speed
 
 Walk_Speed which is the speed at which you move forwards and backwards
 
 Gravity which controls how fast you fall
 
 Jump_Speed which is how much instant velocity is applied to the player
 
 You need to tune both together to create the jump feel you want
 
 This is the basic set up for creating the player I use
